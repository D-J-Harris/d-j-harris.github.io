Hello there, it's good to see you. I'm Miguel‚Äîhobby developer, music enjoyer, and public infrastructure enthusiast. I live in Minnesota, also known as the "Land of 10,000 Lakes" for having over 14,000 bodies of fresh water.

I think a lot, work a lot, have existential crises, and know just enough about making websites to make me dangerous. I enjoy writing, reading, coding, listening to music, and love having a problem to solve.

**As of September 2023, I am‚Ä¶**

‚Ä¶ tending to my [digital garden](https://forgetfulnotes.com/).  
‚Ä¶ making simple browser [extensions](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/17772574/).  
‚Ä¶ collecting bookmarks with [Raindrop](https://raindrop.io/SemanticData).  
‚Ä¶ developing both a [theme](https://github.com/semanticdata/obsidian-sample-theme), and a [starter vault](https://github.com/semanticdata/obsidian-starter-vault) for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).  

Thank you for stopping by. Please tell your dog I said Hi! üê∂
